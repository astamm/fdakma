# fdakma

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The **fdakma** package is only a wrapper around the faster and more
complete [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/index.html)
package, which exposes the k-means alignment algorithm to the user. It is mainly
kept alive because it was advertised under this name when the seminal paper was
published. We strongly encourage R users to switch to using the
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/index.html) from now on.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **fdakma** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astamm/fdakma")
```
